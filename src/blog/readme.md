## Degen-AI Blog Scraper
### Version 1.0

This is a node script built with JavaScript that will take a list of blog/article links and parse their content data into a jsonl file for training an AI.

#### Instructions:

2.) Run `node scrapeBlogs.js`.
3.) Check the generated jsonl file for any extra header, footer, or other unwanted information.
